Hi! My name is Katherine Comer. 

For my project, I sought out to discover if there is a relationship between a player's position, how open their shot was, how far their shot was, and how likely the player was to make their shot.

Generally, I wanted to answer the question if some positions are better at making open shots that others, or if how closely a shooter is being defended and/or how long the shot was has any impact on the probablity of them making the shot.

This project was coded in Python using jupyter notebooks.
